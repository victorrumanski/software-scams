# List of Software Development Scams

This is a list of technologies I believe will die. While they may be popular today, they do not provide 

1) Low Complexity 
2) Runtime Performance Gains 
3) Development time productivity gains

Which at the end of the day are the Only Things that matter in software development

### Current Scams

- NoSql dbs without ACID guarantees
- Frontend ONLY developers
- Single Page Applications - The underlying model of "create html from json data" is beyond a fix
- React/Angular/Vue et all (specially in e-commerce type websites)
- React Server Components - This is the most laughable because to fix React they need to go back to Web circa 2001.
- Javascript on the server
- Big Cloud Providers for start-ups because you can scale from 0 to million of users
- ORMs
- Kubernetes
- Microservices because you can hire dozens of devs and they can work concurrently on different parts of the system

### Scams developers don't fall anymore:

- JSF
- J2EE
- EJB (2 and 3)
- XML Webservices
